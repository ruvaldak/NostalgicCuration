# NostalgicCuration
currently WIP. Curated resource pack containing a mix of vrious Beta themed textures, sounds, modrls, and more. It also contains some handcrafted additions in order to ensure the most authentic, modern rendition of beta 1.7.3 possible.

The goal of this pack is to rework the visuals of minecraft as though it had stuck to the overall style and direction of beta 1.7.3. This means completely redesigning and in some cases renaming things to better fit with how Minecraft was back then - for example, villagers, illagers, pillagers, vindicators, witches, etc have been changed into humans (steve except for witches which are now based on the alex skin).
